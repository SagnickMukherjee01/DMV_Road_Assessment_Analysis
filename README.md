# DMV_Road_Assessment_Analysis

### Project Overview

This project analyzes a simulated DMV road test dataset to uncover the key factors that influence whether applicants pass or fail their driving test. With high failure rates leading to delays and added costs, the study aims to generate actionable insights that can improve training programs, optimize resource allocation, and support applicants in being better prepared.

### Key Objectives

1. Demographic Insights: Explore pass/fail trends across age, gender, and race.

2. Training Effectiveness: Evaluate the impact of different training levels (Advanced, Basic, None) on outcomes.

3. Performance Drivers: Identify the most significant road assessment indicators that predict success.

4. Predictive Modeling: Build and test a logistic regression model to estimate pass likelihood and measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Threshold Analysis: Demonstrate how varying cutoff points affect predictions using confusion matrices.

6. Interactive Dashboards: Design Power BI dashboards with dynamic filters (demographics, training, results) to provide intuitive, real-time insights.
